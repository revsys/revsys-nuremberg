        <h1>NMT Case 11</h1>
        <h2>USA vs. Ernst von Weizsaecker, et al.</h2>

        <p id="summary" class="introduction">
            Trial XI, <i>The United States of America vs. Ernst von Weizsaecker, et al</i>, more commonly known as the "Ministries Case," took place between November 1947 and April 1949. Twenty-one defendants were charged. During the trial, the prosecution introduced over 3200 written exhibits. The defense introduced over 4800 written exhibits. A total of 339 witnesses testified. The trial transcript contains nearly 29,000 pages. The defendants were charged with crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. In addition to testimony heard by the Tribunal, testimony was also heard by three commissioners, at times in other locations, such as Copenhagen and Vienna. Trial XI lasted much longer than the other trials, a total of seventeen months from indictment to judgments.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is of note that hundreds of captured documents were offered during the trial, all of which had been unavailable at the time of the IMT trial; none of these documents had been offered during the other eleven subsequent trials. The Tribunal, in its judgment, stated "The record presents, more fully and completely than in any other case, the story of the rise of the Nazi regime, its programs and its acts."
        </p>

        <p>
            In its indictment, the Prosecution charged the defendants with having committed crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by virtue of waging wars of aggression and invasions of other countries, leading to incalculable destruction, the deaths of millions of people, and the suffering of millions more, as well as to deportation of civilians in occupied countries to slave labor, the enslavement, torture and murder of millions of people, and plunder and spoliation of property in invaded countries. The Prosecution alleged that all of this had occurred as a result of deliberate plans and policies intended to strengthen Germany and secure the permanent domination by Germany of the continent of Europe. The indictment's eight separate counts are outlined below.

They committed crimes against peace in that they were principals in, accessories to, ordered, abetted, took a consenting part in were connected with plans and enterprises involving, and were members of organizations and groups connected with, the commission of crimes against peace. This count included 24 paragraphs of specifications.</p>

        <p><strong>Count Three: War Crimes: Murder and Ill-Treatment of Belligerents and Prisoners of War.</strong> Eight defendants were charged with participation in atrocities and offenses against prisoners of war, including murder, ill-treatment, enslavement, brutalities, cruelties, and other inhumane acts, all in flagrant violation of the laws and customs of war.</p>

        <p><strong>Count Four: Crimes against Humanity: Atrocities and Offenses Committed against German Nationals on Political, Racial, and Religious Grounds from 1933-1939.</strong> 13 defendants were charged with taking part in atrocities directed at German nationals: murder, enslavement, imprisonment, plundering and looting of property, and other persecutions committed on political, racial, and religious grounds. (This charge, based on activities taking place prior to outbreak of war, was dropped during the trial.)</p>

        <p><strong>Count Five: War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity: Atrocities and Offenses Committed against Civilian Populations.</strong> 19 defendants were charged with taking part in atrocities including murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, killing of hostages, torture, and persecution on political, racial and religious grounds, directed at both German nationals and civilians of occupied lands. This count included wanton destruction of cities, towns, and villages, and devastation not justified by military necessity.</p>

        <p><strong>Count Six: War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity: Plunder and Spoliation.</strong> 16 defendants were charged with plunder of public and private property, exploitation, spoliation and other offenses against property and the civilian economies of occupied countries. The indictment stated that these activities were part of a deliberate plan to strengthen Germany and secure its permanent domination of Europe. Items seized included agricultural products, raw materials, machine tools, transportation equipment, and foreign securities, as well as art treasures, furniture, textiles, etc. Industrial facilities in the coal, steel, and armament industries were also expropriated.
