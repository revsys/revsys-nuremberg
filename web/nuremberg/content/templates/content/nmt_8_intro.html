        <h1>NMT Case 8</h1>
        <h2>USA vs. Ulrich Greifelt, et al.</h2>

        <p id="summary" class="introduction">
            Trial VIII, <i>The United States of America vs. Ulrich Greifelt, et al</i>, more commonly known as the "RuSHA Trial," took place between July 1947 and March 1948. Fourteen defendants were charged; one defendant was removed from the trial for health reasons, leaving thirteen on trial. During the trial, the prosecution introduced 2,000 written exhibits and 39 witnesses, and the defense introduced 1400 written exhibits and 70 witnesses. The tribunal convened 124 times; the trial transcript totals 8700 pages. The defendants were charged with crimes against humanity and membership in criminal organizations.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the Third Reich, individuals of sufficient Nordic or Aryan lineage, who possessed the proper physical, mental, and characterological traits deemed desirable by the National Socialist regime, were regarded as valuable additions to the German population. These individuals were often encouraged or forced to migrate within Germany or to German-occupied territories for the purpose of Germanization. Jews, Poles, and other ethnic groups were not considered "worthy" of Germanization and were systematically eliminated through various means.
        </p>

        <p>
            The RuSHA (Race and Settlement Main Office) was the primary SS agency charged with strengthening the racial "quality" of the German people and Germanizing occupied territories. This included racial examinations, marriage approvals, and the kidnapping of thousands of children from Eastern European countries who were considered "racially valuable." The Lebensborn program provided maternity homes for unmarried mothers of "racially pure" offspring, and also participated in the kidnapping program. The defendants were also charged with participating in the evacuation, deportation, and resettlement of hundreds of thousands of persons, particularly Jews and Poles, in order to make room for ethnic German settlers.
