    <h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>
The Harvard Law School Library uniquely owns and manages approximately one million pages of documents relating to the trial of military and political leaders of Nazi Germany before the International Military Tribunal (IMT) and the subsequent twelve trials of other accused Nazi war criminals before the United States Nuremberg Military Tribunals (NMT) during the period 1945-49.  Considered by many to be the most significant series of trials in history, these trials were established to prosecute those in authority in the Nazi regime for war crimes and crimes against humanity, to document those atrocities so that a permanent historical record would be created, and to establish a standard of conduct acceptable in time of war.</p>

<p>The documents -- which include trial transcripts and full trial exhibits and related materials -- have been studied by lawyers, scholars and other researchers in the areas of history, ethics, genocide, and war crimes, and are of particular interest to officials and students of current international tribunals involving war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>To preserve the contents of these documents -- which are now too fragile to be handled -- and to provide expanded access to this material, the Library has undertaken a multi-stage digitization project, originally conceived in the late 1990s and implemented in stages since then.  The Nuremberg Trials Project is an open-access initiative to create, present and make accessible digitized images of the Library's Nuremberg documents, document descriptions, associated transcripts in both full-text and image formats and general information about the trials.</p>

<p>The documents include transcripts recording the full protocol of courtroom activity over the course of each trial, indictments, arraignments, opening and closing statements, trial briefs, the documents submitted into evidence by both prosecution and defense, as well as the much larger set of source documents from which the trial exhibits were selected for use by lawyers.</p>

<p>While the document collection is primarily text-based, we have also included over 200 digitized photographs from the Nuremberg Tribunals from the Harvard Library's Visual Information Access (VIA) catalog.</p>

<h2>Materials Currently Provided by the Project</h2>

<p>
The Nuremberg Trials Project website provides access to the document record and other associated materials for 
all thirteen trials.  We provide digital images of all documents and currently full-text versions of most 
prosecution trial exhibits and most of the trial transcripts.  We plan to offer soon full text for all 
prosecution exhibits and subsequently all defense exhibits and evidence files.  Both prosecution and trial 
exhibits as well as all trial transcripts are currently only offered in the English-language versions used 
at the time of the Trials.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that our collection, while substantially complete, does contain minor gaps in the 
documentary record with the result that some documents are simply not currently available on our website.
</p>

<p>
You can search and view materials in a variety of ways. For example, you can search for a specific document 
or a group of documents by querying the underlying prepared document descriptions and/or by searching the 
full-text versions for those documents currently offering them.  You can then review the resulting search 
results, select particular documents for further inspection and proceed to the document images and full text 
(where provided).  Or you can begin with the transcript and use it as a roadmap to the document collection, 
locating the documents cited in context and moving from there to review the document images and text.
