  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Trial X, <i>The United States of America vs. Alfried Krupp, et al</i>, also known as the "Krupp Trial", took place between August 1947 and July 1948; appeals of sentences continued through 1949. Twelve defendants were charged: Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, Ewald Loeser, Eduard Houdremont, Erich Mueller, Friedrich Janssen, Karl Pfirsch, Max Ihn, Karl Eberhardt, Heinrich Korschan, Friedrich von Buelow, Werner Lehmann, and Hans Kupke. During the trial, the prosecution introduced over 1400 written exhibits; the defense introduced over 2800. These exhibits consisted of documents, photographs, affidavits, letters, and charts. Testimony was heard from over 200 witnesses. The tribunal convened 103 times over eleven months.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was the third and final of the so-called industrialist cases tried in Nuernberg. The defendants were the owner and leading officials in the Krupp Concern. The man who had headed the company until 1943, Gustav Krupp, the father of the first named defendant, was not indicted because of incapacity to stand trial (due to illness). He had also been indicted in the Trial of the Major War Criminals (IMT), but the Tribunal granted an application by his lawyer for postponement of the proceedings. As he did not recover, his son, who headed the firm from 1943 on, was indicted in his stead.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alfried Krupp and eight of the defendants were members of the Managing Board (Vorstand) of the company. From December 1943, Alfried Krupp was the sole owner and directing head of the Krupp concern. The Krupp concern was "a gigantic vertical enterprise, composed principally of coal and iron ore mines, blast furnaces, rolling mills, shipyards, machine, armament and other manufacturing plants; in 1939 it consisted of at least 175 domestic and 60 foreign subsidiary units."
