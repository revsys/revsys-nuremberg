        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The Medical Case, U.S.A. vs. Karl Brandt, et al. (also known as the Doctors'
        Trial), was prosecuted in 1946-47 against twenty-three doctors and administrators
        accused of organizing and participating in war crimes and crimes against humanity
        in the form of medical experiments and medical procedures inflicted on prisoners
        and civilians.</p>
        <p>Karl Brandt, the lead defendant, was the senior medical official of the German
        government during World War II; other defendants included senior doctors and
        administrators in the armed forces and SS. They were indicted on four counts: 1.
        conspiracy to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity; 2. war crimes (i.e.,
        crimes against persons protected by the laws of war, such as prisoners of war);
        3. crimes against humanity (including persons not protected by the laws of war);
        and 4. membership in a criminal organization (the SS).</p>
        <p>The specific crimes charged included more than twelve series of medical
        experiments concerning the effects of and treatments for high altitude
        conditions, freezing, malaria, poison gas, sulfanilamide, bone, muscle, and nerve
        regeneration, bone transplantation, saltwater consumption, epidemic jaundice,
        sterilization, typhus, poisons, and incendiary bombs.</p>
        <p>These experiments were conducted on concentration camp inmates. Other crimes
        involved the killing of Jews for anatomical research, the killing of tubercular
        Poles, and the euthanasia of sick and disabled civilians in Germany and occupied
        territories. The defendants were charged with ordering, supervising, or
        coordinating criminal activities, as well as participating in them directly. The
        fourth count concerned membership in the SS (Schuttzstaffeln) of the Nazi
        regime.</p>
        <p>Karl Brandt and six other defendants were convicted, sentenced to death, and
        executed; nine defendants were convicted and sentenced to terms in prison; and
        seven defendants were acquitted.</p>
        <p>The material presented in this project includes case file documents (the
        briefs and document books created and used in the course of the trial), evidence
        file documents (the evidentiary documents from which the prosecution, and
        occasionally the defendants, derived their exhibits), and the trial
        transcript.</p>
        <p>The trial documents and evidence file documents related to Case 1 amount to
        approximately 2800 documents and 13,000 pages of material.</p>
