  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Trial V, <i>The United States of America vs. Friedrich Flick, et al</i>, also known as the "Flick Trial," took place between April and December 1947. Six defendants were charged: Friedrich Flick, Konrad Kaletsch, Otto Steinbrinck, Odilo Burkart, Hermann Terberger, and Bernhard Weiss. The trial transcript exceeds 8500 pages. The defendants were charged with crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The prosecution attempted to prove that the six defendants were parties to the planning, preparation, initiation and waging of aggressive wars by the Third Reich. The prosecution also sought to demonstrate that they participated in the plunder and spoliation of property in countries invaded by Germany as well as in the deportation and enslavement of millions of civilians from such occupied countries.
  </p>

  <p>
    The case against the defendants rested primarily on documents recording the activities of the Flick Concern and the four other firms headed or controlled by Friedrich Flick from the 1930s through 1944. The defendants held executive positions in these firms, and Flick was the major shareholder of them all. Flick and his firms profited considerably from the aggressive Nazi military actions of the Third Reich. This included participation in the "Aryanization" process (confiscation of Jewish property) as well as exploitation of slave labor during the war, primarily from concentration camps. The defendants were also accused of making large contributions to Himmler.
