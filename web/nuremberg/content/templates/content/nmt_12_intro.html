  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Trial XII, <i>The United States of America vs. Wilhelm von Leeb, et al</i>, more commonly known as "The High Command Case", took place between November 1947 and October 1948. Fourteen defendants, all high-ranking German military leaders, were charged. During the trial, the prosecution introduced 1778 written exhibits and called 32 witnesses; the defense introduced 2130 written exhibits and called 65 witnesses. The tribunal convened 233 times over ten months; the transcript contains 10,316 pages. The defendants were charged with crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, as well as participating in a common plan or conspiracy to commit such crimes. One defendant, Johannes Blaskowitz, committed suicide during the trial, in February 1948; hence only thirteen defendants stood trial.
  </p>

  <p>
    In presenting the case, the prosecution devoted considerable time to describing clandestine re-armament carried out during the Weimar Republic years, in defiance of the Versailles Treaty. The prosecution described how the military leadership worked with Hitler from 1933 onwards to rapidly strengthen preparations for war, including production of airplanes and submarines as early as 1935, the year that Hitler publicly repudiated the Versailles Treaty and reoccupied the Rhineland. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War a year later provided a testing ground for the German Air Force. One of the defendants, Sperrle, headed the famed "Condor Legion" during this war in Spain.
  </p>

  <p>
    After outlining the involvement of the German military in rapid rearmament and preparation for war, the prosecution discussed the defendants' participation in the many invasions and wars of aggression conducted by the Third Reich, from the annexation of Austria in 1938 to the declaration of war on the United States at the end of 1941.
  </p>

  <p>
    Counts Two and Three present several specific instances of war crimes and crimes against humanity, both against enemy soldiers and civilians. These include:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>The Commando Order:</strong> this 1942 Hitler decree stated that captured enemy commando troops were to be summarily executed whenever encountered</li>
    <li><strong>The "Terror Flier" Decree:</strong> this 1944 order stipulated that Anglo-American downed fliers should not be protected from the actions of the civilian population; the order led to the slaughter of many Allied airmen</li>
    <li><strong>The "Night and Fog" Decree</strong> ("Nacht und Nebel Erlass"): this 1941 decree stated that non-German civilians accused of anti-German acts would be taken to Germany without a trial, and their families would receive no information as to their fate. One of the defendants, Lehmann, was described as the "guiding spirit" behind the formulation, issuance, and execution of this decree, which resulted in the torture, ill-treatment, and murder of thousands of civilians.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The prosecution addressed four specific topics related to hostage-taking and the mass executions that had taken place in Eastern Europe from 1941 on:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>the "Commissar Order" (Kommissarbefehl) of 1941, which stated that all 'commissars' or military functionaries in the Soviet Union should be immediately killed rather than granted POW status;</li>
    <li>the ill-treatment and deaths of many hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war in the Soviet Union (most of whom died from starvation or exposure);</li>
    <li>the participation of the Wehrmacht in the extermination of over one million Jews in the USSR (the "Einsatzgruppen" operation, which became the focus of Trial IX)</li>
    <li>Wehrmacht participation in the slave labor program, as a result of which millions of civilians and prisoners of war were deported and enslaved.</li>
  </ol>
